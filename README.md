Example-Task
============

Purely basic.  
This console application does the following:

1. Task A and E  
   Populates a container of employees from a .txt file, sorts them on insertion by
   their salary, checks format of the file entries, writes the collection to the console.
2. Task B  
   Writes the names of the first five employees to the console.
3. Task C  
   Writes the IDs of the last three employees to the console.
4. Task D  
   Writes the collection of employees to the file, then reads it.
